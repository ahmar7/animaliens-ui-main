                  commercialized products make or are expected to make over $1
                  million a year, that owner must reach a side agreement with
                  the SpaceBudz to ensure the SpaceBudz vision is protected from
                  outside large corporate cooption, and (2) you must be clear as
                  to who is creating the product and not imply or suggest the
                  originators of the Licensed Merchandise is the SpaceBudz team.
